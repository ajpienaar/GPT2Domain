A craft handed down for generations, Interlink is proud to represent SUGI timbers in the South Island of New Zealand, offering only hand selected and sustainably grown natural or charred timber for highly durable cladding.
Naturally treated and extremely low maintenance, this quality timber has a natural beauty and proven durability that will last for generations.
Timber has long played an important role in Japanese architecture, and as such, has been respected as a precious and finite resource. With world class planting and management systems that are GOHO certified, SUGI timber is hand selected and graded in Japan, then manufactured in New Zealand to industry standards.
Practising ethical forestry, careful cultivation and an ongoing commitment to sustainable growth practices, SUGI timber just might be the perfect choice for your next build.

Wall Cladding - Exterior
Dento
Charred and oiled.Heat treated, charred and coated with natural oils, the Dento finish uses a natural oil to solidify the carbon layer, minimising blemishes and offering longevity to both the timber and its natural colour. We recommend re-oiling every 10-20 years to prolong the layer of black carbon.

Makkuro
Charred, brushed and oiled.The Makurro finish offers Japanese cedar that is heat treated, charred, then lightly brushed before being factory coated using natural oils. While the light brush leaves behind a smooth, lightly burned appearance, the oiling process protects and prolongs the natural colour of the timber.

Wabi Sabi
Charred, double-brushed, coloured and oiled.The Wabi Sabi finish sees Japanese cedar heat treated, charred, then brushed twice to remove most of the soot from the softwood, leaving only carbon on the fine hardwood grain. The hardwood is then coloured with natural oils before the final factory coat to seal. Every board is finished by hand, resulting in a truly beautiful cladding with an enhanced timber grain.

Kiyama
Grown in the fertile soils of Japan, SUGI’s world class Kiyama cladding brings a piece of the natural environment into your build. Kiyama is a completely natural product with no toxic glue or lamination required, sustainably harvested and highly durable to withstand the extremes of the New Zealand climate. For centuries, Kiyama has been used in Japanese architecture as a proven, durable and sustainable alternative to carbon-intensive engineered products.

European Oversized Lengths
These oversized bearers are sourced from European railway lines, and cannot be found elsewhere in New Zealand. The generous 300mm widths combined with the unusually long lengths (from 2.6m right up to 4.6m) are a true rarity in railway sleepers. They are the perfect medium where beams are not suitable, but prominence is desired. These pieces can be used in large, linear installations or joined together for robust practical functions such as walls and pergolas.
Best for: Indoor and outdoor use, large visual displays, pergolas, retaining, edging, and garden features.
Timber Species: Mixed used European timbers

Additional Info: These unique pieces are not suitable to be highly worked due to density and rarity. Ideal for non-structural builds (unless structural integrity achieved  elsewhere), these timbers can be left as is to show weathering and original timber growth, or can be further finished by wire brush or ageing processes.

Sandblasted Wharf & Bridge Hardwood Beams
Sandblasted Wharf & Bridge Hardwood Beams are highly sought-after, adding a unique character and value that dramatically enhance interior designs. These exposed grains can be further finished for smooth surfaces, or left bare to showcase weathering and original timber growth, allowing for unique, custom pieces to be created.
Best for: Indoor features, mantels, window framing, seating, entrance pillars, exposed trusses, fire mantels, interior fixtures. Typically permanent once in place, so better suited for features with high visibility and exposure.

Unique Features: Commonly the centrepoint of designs and builds, these non-structural, exposed grains are made prominent through sandblasting or wire brushing.

One-off pieces and lengths as per availability and dimensions, minimum order subject to availability. Please note, used beams are not off-the-shelf supply.
Architects and designers are best to contact Interlink Ltd first to see what beams are available.
